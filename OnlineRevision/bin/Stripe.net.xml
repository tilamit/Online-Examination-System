            This converter is used to deserialize attributes declared as `IHasObject` into concrete
            model classes. In other words, this converter can deserialize any Stripe object based on
            the value of the <c>object</c> attribute. This is useful when the type of the object has
            to be determined at runtime, such as when decoding the <c>data.object</c> attribute of
            event objects.
